# Rose Michael - portfolio site
### writer  |  publisher  |  academic

## Description
A single page responsive portfolio site showcasing Rose Michael's published works.

## Functionality:
Designed to contain each work within modular 'windows' that display published covers and blurbs - each module can be click to reveal scrolling written examples, allowing users to interact without page-redirection or page-load disruption. This was achieved using jQuery to manipulate CSS selectors on mouse events, and the slick carousel framework.

The site also needed to have a minimal and practical design aesthetic, as well as to be dynamic and responsive (with swipe Functionality on mobile devices) - which was achieved through jQuery, event-listeners, CSS transitions and transformations and the slick framework.

### Tools:
- CSS/Flexbox
- jQuery/JavaScript
- HTML5
- Slick carousel framework http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick
